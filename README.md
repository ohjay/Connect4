# Connect4
The classic game of Connect Four, enhanced with several modern modifications. 

A work in a progress; currently playable only by compiling all of the source files and running the program through the main() method in the Connect4/Connect4 class. This was built originally as a proof to my friend that Connect Four is a solved game.

**Update [8/8/15]**: A playable demo should be out within the next 3 months!
