# Connect4: Warfare
Hello! I see you're looking at the Warfare branch. **Warfare**, in case you didn't know, is one of the modes that was unfortunately cut from the game. In theory, it would have allowed four people to play simultaneously on a double-sized board. The board would not involve the usual gravity factor, so a player would be able to set down pieces... well, anywhere.

Sounds fun, right? Maybe? Well, in contemplation I realized a few things: that the board would probably need to be bigger than I'd set the screen size to be, that I'd have to restructure class hierarchies, and that I'd also have to write a bunch more game-handling code (more than I needed to for "Removal" or "Four by Two," at least). 

Normally, these are all adjustments that I'd be okay with making. However, I've been feeling a bit pessimistic about these projects, as I realized they don't have that much of an impact on anything past their meaning to me. And even _that_ has been waning: it's fun to make these things, but recently I've been finding game logic increasingly less stimulating to program. Honestly, I'd like to get started on a different breed of project as soon as possible â€“ and since I feel obligated to finish Connect4 before I do that, I decided to simply end all development on Warfare. Effective immediately.

That being the case, here you can view the start I'd made on it. This comes out to exactly one commit, in which I refactored some board code. Hooray!

P.S. Another reason for Warfare's discontinuation is that I doubt it would see much use. If I'm wrong about that, and you really want to play some 4P Connect Four, you can let me know. And I can have it up for you in about a day. :)
