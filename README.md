# Connect4
The classic game of Connect Four, enhanced with several modern modifications. 

A work in a progress; currently playable only by compiling all of the source files and running the program through the main() method in the Connect4/Connect4 class. This was built originally as a proof to my friend that Connect Four is a solved game.

**Update [9/13/15]**: A playable demo should be out within the next 2 months! As soon as I perfect my minimax methods, work should proceed relatively quickly.

## Implementation Details
Connect4 is a Swing application that allows the user to enjoy several different game modes:

- **vs CPU**: uses a depth-limited [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to choose moves for the AI player
