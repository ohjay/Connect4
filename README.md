# Connect4
The classic game of Connect Four, enhanced with several modern modifications. 

A work in a progress; currently playable only by compiling all of the source files and running the program through the main() method in the Connect4/Connect4 class. This was built originally as a proof to my friend that Connect Four is a solved game.

## Development Timeline
- [By **12/09/15 @ 11:59pm**] Working minimax for the CPU panels
- [By **12/11/15 @ 11:59pm**] All special modes complete
- [By **12/21/15 @ 11:59pm**] Boards + networked connection modes complete
- [By **12/27/15 @ 11:59pm**] UI in a polished state (incl. post-game screen + score tracking?), game in release-friendly form overall!

## Implementation Details
Connect4 is a Swing application that allows the user to enjoy several different game modes:

- **vs CPU**: uses a depth-limited [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to choose moves for the AI player
